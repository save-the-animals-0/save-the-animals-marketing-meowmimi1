# To Do
- [ ]  You will build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build.
- [ ]  Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. Please see the "Responsiveness" portion of your rubric for more information on this.
- [ ]  The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that your Front End Architect is building.
- [ ]  Your marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like "Netlify" or "Github Pages".
- [ ]  For this Marketing site's home page you need to have content and copy that relates to the product that your team is workinfg on.
- [ ]  Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides would be key.
- [ ]  For a second page, you could do an about us section that includes images of the members of your team, and links to one another's socials/Github.
